<h2>How to Play Circular Arrangement</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Each question presents a set of circular arrangement relationships. For instance:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sand is to the right of Kangaroo</li>
    <li>Cello is to the immediate right of Sand</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>To solve the puzzle, arrange the subjects in a circle based on the provided premises.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Since "Sand is to the right of Kangaroo," place "Sand" immediately to the right of "Kangaroo" in a clockwise direction.</li>
    <li>"Cello is to the immediate right of Sand," so place "Cello" immediately to the right of "Sand," continuing clockwise.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Based on the circular arrangement you've created, you may need to evaluate the validity of a specific statement. For example, if the statement is "Kangaroo is to the immediate left of Cello," you would check your arrangement.</p>
<p>If your arrangement shows that "Kangaroo" is directly to the left of "Cello" (immediately counterclockwise from "Cello"), then you would click <strong>True</strong>. If not, click <strong>False</strong>.</p>
