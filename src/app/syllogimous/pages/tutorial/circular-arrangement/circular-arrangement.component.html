<h2>How to Play Circular Arrangement</h2>

<p>Each question presents a set of circular arrangement relationships. For instance:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sand is to the right of Kangaroo</li>
    <li>Cello is to the immediate right of Sand</li>
</ul>

<p>To solve the puzzle, arrange the subjects in a circle based on the provided premises.</p>
<p>If the conclusion is "Kangaroo is to the immediate left of Cello," and your arrangement shows that "Kangaroo" is directly to the left of "Cello", then you would click <strong>True</strong>. If not, click <strong>False</strong>.</p>
