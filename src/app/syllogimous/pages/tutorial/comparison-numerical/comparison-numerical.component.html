<h2>How to Play Comparison Numerical</h2>

<p>Each question presents you with a set of comparisons between different items. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sea is more than Turtle</li>
    <li>Wrist is less than Turtle</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to determine if the conclusion is logically valid based on the relationships given. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> "Wrist is less than Sea."</p>

<p>Based on the comparisons (Wrist &lt; Turtle &lt; Sea), this conclusion would be <strong>True</strong>.</p>
