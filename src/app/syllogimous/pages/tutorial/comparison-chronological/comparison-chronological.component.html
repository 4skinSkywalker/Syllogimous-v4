<h2>How to Play Comparison Chronological</h2>
<p>Comparison chronological questions have a series of premises that describe the relative order of items. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Knife is after Shoulder</li>
    <li>Knife is before Hostel</li>
    <li>Desktop is after Hostel</li>
</ul>

<p>You may be asked to verify a statement like "Is the Knife correctly positioned after the Desktop?" Given the premises, you would determine that this sequence is <strong>False</strong>.</p>
<p>After selecting <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>, you'll receive feedback, allowing you to see if your reasoning was correct.</p>
