<h2>How to Play Direction3D Temporal</h2> 
<p>Direction3D Temporal questions are spatial reasoning challenges that require you to visualize and deduce the relative positions of different objects in a three-dimensional space. Hereâ€™s how you can play:</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Each Direction3D Temporal question presents a series of statements that describe the relative positions of objects. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Statement 1:</strong> Hammer is in the future and North of Church</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 2:</strong> Dates is in the present and North-West of Hammer</li>
    <li><strong>Statement 3:</strong> Church is in the past and South-East of Dates</li>
</ul>
<p>These statements describe the temporal and spatial relationships between the objects.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>To solve the puzzle, try to mentally visualize the spatial and temporal layout of the objects:</p>
<p>Imagine positioning the objects in a three-dimensional space where directions like north and south, east and west, and temporal states like past, present, and future are clearly distinguishable.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>After understanding each object's position and their relations to each other, test your understanding with a question. For example:</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> "Is the Church to the south-east of the Dates?"</p>
<p>Based on the given statements, visualize their positions to answer the question.</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Based on your analysis, click the answer that best fits your visualization.</p>
<p>For instance, if you believe the statement is true, select 'True'. Otherwise, select 'False'.</p>
<p>After making your choice, the game will confirm whether you were correct or not, helping you refine your spatial reasoning skills.</p>

<h3>The <span class="is-negated">Negation</span> Cue</h3>
<p>Whenever you encounter a phrase highlighted in <span class="is-negated">red</span>, it's an indication that you need to think inversely about the information presented.</p>

<h3>Tips for Success</h3>
<p><strong>Use a mental map:</strong> Visualize or draw a simple sketch to track the positions of each object.</p>
<p><strong>Consider all dimensions:</strong> Remember that positions can change along multiple axes (north-south, east-west, above-below, and temporal).</p>
