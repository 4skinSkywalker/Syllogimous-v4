<h2>How to Play Linear Arrangement</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Each question has a series of linear arrangement relationships. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Chicken is to the immediate right of Cinema</li>
    <li>Bike is to the immediate right of Chicken</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>To solve the puzzle, arrange the subjects linearly based on the premises.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Since "Chicken is to the immediate right of Cinema," place "Chicken" immediately to the right of "Cinema."</li>
    <li>"Bike is to the immediate right of Chicken," so "Bike" should be positioned immediately to the right of "Chicken."</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Based on the linear arrangement you've mapped out, you might be asked to determine the validity of a specific statement. If the question provides a new statement like "Cinema is to the immediate left of Bike," you would compare it against your linear arrangement.</p>
<p>If your arrangement shows that "Cinema" is to the left of "Chicken" (not directly to the left of "Bike"), you would click <strong>False</strong>. If the statement accurately reflects your arrangement, click <strong>True</strong>.</p>
