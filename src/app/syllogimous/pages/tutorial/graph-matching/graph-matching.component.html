<h2>How to Play Graph Matching</h2>

<p>First, visualize the graph from the premises:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Eave originates from Leaves</li>
    <li>Clothes originate from Eave</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, visualize the graph for the conclusion:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Panther leads to Wander</li>
    <li>Wander leads to Bell</li>
</ul>

<p>Examine whether the two graphs are isomorphic. This means checking for a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices and edges that maintains connectivity.</p>

<p>If the premise and conclusion graphs match structurally, click the <strong>True</strong> button. Otherwise, click the <strong>False</strong> button.</p>
