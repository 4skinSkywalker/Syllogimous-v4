<p>Each question provides a series of statements that describe the positions of different entities relative to each other in both space and time. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Taxi was Below and West of Dentist</li>
    <li>Dentist is North of Woman</li>
    <li>Woman was Above and South-West of Shark</li>
    <li>Shark was West of Taxi</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, evaluate the conclusion or question based on the relationships you have mapped out. For example, if asked:</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> "Is it possible that the Shark is now North of the Dentist?"</p>

<p>Based on your analysis, click the <strong>True</strong> button if you believe the given relationship is correct or the <strong>False</strong> button if you think it is not.</p>
